PROJECT TITLE: Final Project 
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This game was inspired by the mechanics and feel of Geometry Dash, but it was built from scratch as a personal high school project. 
VERSION or DATE: June 8th, 2022 
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Download BlueJ 3.17 or later, as this program requires the applet version of BlueJ to run. 
AUTHORS: Rachel Velez
USER INSTRUCTIONS: After clicking "Run Applet," use the up arrow key to move the block and avoid obstacles. 

WHAT I LEARNED: 
- How to build a side-scrolling platformer in Java.
- The logic behind collision detection and how to use timers and sync changes (like background color) with music timing.
- How to creatively design around a rhythm, even without advanced tools or frameworks.
NOTE: This game is simple and unfinished, but it taught me a lot about how games are built and what it feels like to bring an idea to life through code.

REFLECTION: 
I worked really hard to understand Java, especially during my senior year when I was preparing for the AP Computer Science A exam. This project was the first time I truly felt 
I could take what I learned and turn it into something of my own. Even though the game is simple and not fully polished, creating it from scratch made me feel proud of how far I
had come. It reminded me that all the effort I put into learning the language paid off, not just for the exam, but for myself.
