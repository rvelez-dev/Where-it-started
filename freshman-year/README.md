FRESHMAN YEAR PROJECTS 
- These files are a collection of Java projects I built during my freshman year of high school (age 14), with guidance and support from my programming teacher. 

WHAT THESE PROJECTS TAUGHT ME 
Each program introduced a core programming concept, many of which laid the foundation for my later understanding of Java and computer science in general 

Projects explored: 
- GUI elements (buttons, mouse click actions)
- Basic arithmetic and calculator logic
- Movement of objects
- Use of randomizers
- Drawing strings and simple visual outputs
- Action listeners and event handling

These concepts were difficult for me at the time, but learning them helped me build confidence in logic and syntax. It was also the first time I was introduced to logic groups, a daily exercise in which my partners and I problem-solved logic problems and puzzles together. 

WHY I'M POSTING THESE 
This repo honors where I started. It reminds me that every complex project begins with simple steps, and that the journey from struggling student to confident creator is something to be proud of. 
Even though these programs aren't polished or perfect, they represent a chapter of hard work and mentorship that shaped who I am as a programmer today. 

Note on Copyright: 
I created additional freshman year projects during this time, but I've chosen not to include them here due to copyright concerns related to the use of external images or assets.
